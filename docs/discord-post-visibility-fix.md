# Discord Post Visibility Fix

## 🔍 Issue Identified

**Problem**: Users couldn't see newly generated posts when using `!view-scheduled` command in Discord.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between post creation workflow and Discord command expectations.

## 📊 Analysis

### The Workflow
1. `!generate-post` creates posts with status `"draft"`
2. Immediately updates them to `"pending_review"` 
3. Posts remain in `"pending_review"` status until explicitly scheduled

### The Problem
- Default `!view-scheduled` command only looked for posts with status `"scheduled"`
- Newly generated posts had status `"pending_review"`
- Users couldn't see their newly created posts

### Database Evidence
```
📝 draft: 2 posts
📝 pending_review: 1 posts  ← Newly generated posts
📝 scheduled: 2 posts       ← Only these were visible to !view-scheduled
📝 published: 6 posts
📝 failed: 2 posts
```

## 🛠️ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Default View Behavior
**File**: `src/clients/discord/commandHandler.ts`

**Change**: Modified `!view-scheduled` default behavior
```typescript
// Before
const statusFilter = args[0] || 'scheduled';

// After  
const statusFilter = args[0] || 'pending_review';
```

**Impact**: Now `!view-scheduled` shows newly generated posts by default.

### 2. Added New Command
**Added**: `!view-pending` command specifically for newly generated posts

**Purpose**: 
- Shows posts in `"pending_review"` and `"draft"` status
- Provides clear interface for newly generated content
- Includes helpful action buttons

### 3. Enhanced View Options
**Added**: `!view-scheduled active` command
- Shows both `"pending_review"` and `"scheduled"` posts
- Most useful for users managing their content pipeline

### 4. Updated Help Documentation
**Enhanced**: Help message with better organization and examples
- Clear categorization of commands
- Quick start guide
- Practical examples

### 5. Fixed Database Constraints
**Issue**: TypeScript interface included `"started"` status not supported by database
**Fix**: Updated interface to match database constraints
```typescript
status?: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'
```
