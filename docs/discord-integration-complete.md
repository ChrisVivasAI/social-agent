# Discord Integration - Phase 3 Complete! üéâ

## Overview

We have successfully implemented **Phase 3: Discord Command Handlers** for the Enhanced Social Media Agent. The system now provides a complete Discord-based workflow for managing social media posts with interactive commands.

## üöÄ What's New

### Enhanced Workflow
- **Draft-First Approach**: Posts are now created as drafts instead of being published immediately
- **Human Review**: All posts require human approval before publishing
- **Interactive Commands**: Full Discord command system for post management
- **Multi-Image Support**: Multiple image options with selection capabilities
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: All interactions are logged in the database

### Discord Command System

   - Parses Discord commands
   - Routes to appropriate handlers
   - Records all interactions
   - Provides error handling

2. **Enhanced Discord Client** (`src/clients/discord/client.ts`)
   - Integrates command handler
   - Handles Discord events
   - Manages bot lifecycle

### Database Schema

The system uses enhanced database tables:
- `posts` - Main post data with workflow states
